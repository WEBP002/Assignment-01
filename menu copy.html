                    more upscale restaurant called "Smith's Table." The new restaurant earned numerous awards 
                    and became one of the city's most sought-after reservations. 
                    Chef John Smith continued to innovate and evolve his menu while maintaining a commitment to sustainability. 
                    Today, he is a culinary icon in the city, and his restaurants are beloved by locals and visitors alike.

                                In a large saucepan, heat the chicken broth over medium heat.
                                In a separate pan, sauté the shallot and garlic in butter until translucent.
                                Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir for 1-2 minutes until the rice is coated in the butter mixture.
                                Add the white wine and stir until the wine has been absorbed by the rice.
                                Begin adding the hot chicken broth to the rice mixture, one cup at a time, stirring constantly until each cup has been absorbed before adding the next.
                                Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, add the cooked lobster meat, truffle oil, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper, stirring to combine.
                                Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of truffle oil if desired.

                                    Pan-seared duck breast with cherry reduction sauce is a delicious and elegant dish 
                                    that features tender and juicy duck breast complemented 
                                    by a tangy and slightly sweet cherry reduction sauce.

                                Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
                                Score the skin of the duck breasts in a crisscross pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat. Season the duck breasts generously with salt and black pepper.
                                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil to the skillet and place the duck breasts skin side down in the skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Flip the duck breasts over and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                                Transfer the duck breasts to a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F (57°C) for medium-rare.
                                Remove the duck breasts from the oven and let them rest for 5-10 minutes.
                                While the duck breasts are resting, make the cherry reduction sauce. In the same skillet used to cook the duck breasts, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped shallot and garlic, and sauté until softened, about 2-3 minutes.
                                Add the chicken stock, red wine, chopped cherries, honey, and balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer until it has reduced by half and thickened, about 10-15 minutes.
                                Season the cherry reduction sauce with salt and black pepper to taste.
                                Slice the duck breasts and serve them with the cherry reduction sauce drizzled on top.
